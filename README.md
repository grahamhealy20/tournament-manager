# tournament-manager
An application for hosting soccer tournaments!

This is a small Django project to run and manage football (soccer) âš½ tournaments! It provides the admin the ability to create tournaments, add teams and create fixtures. It also provides a live dashboard with real-time scores and league table! 

This exists because we wanted to run a soccer tournament in memory of the late [Jem Byrne](https://www.echo.ie/ballyfermot/article/cherry-orchard-fc-pay-fitting-tribute-to-club-legend-jem-byrne) who passed away in 2017.

We didn't have a way of tracking the scores and we wanted a nice way to manage the groupings and knockouts. We also wanted people to be able to see the scores in real-time in the clubhouse. The dashboard refreshes every few seconds so you can stream it to a monitor using a Chromecast.

To set this up, create a virtualenv or use pipenv to install the dependencies:

`pipenv install` or `pip install -r requirements.txt`
